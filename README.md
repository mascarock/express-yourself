[Frontend Repository](https://github.com/mascarock/frontend-fiesta)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 12 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-yourself.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd express-yourself
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Server

Start the server by running:

```bash
node .
```

The server will start on **[localhost:5005](http://localhost:5005)** by default.

---

## Docker Instructions

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the backend, run the following command from the project root directory:

```bash
docker build -t express-yourself-backend .
```

### Running the Docker Container

To run the Docker container for the backend, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 5005:5005 --name backend-container express-yourself-backend
```

This will start the backend container and expose it on **port 5005** on your local machine.

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run the test suite using **Mocha** and **Chai**:

```bash
npm test
```

This command executes all tests located in the `tests` directory, allowing you to verify that all endpoints and functionalities are working as expected.

### Running Test Coverage

Launch the test coverage report using **Jest**:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

This will generate a detailed coverage report, helping you identify untested parts of your codebase. The report is typically saved in the `coverage` directory.

---

## Linting

### Running Linter

Lint your code using **StandardJS**:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command checks your code for any style issues and reports them in the console.

### Fixing Linting Issues

To automatically fix linting issues, run:

```bash
npx standard --fix
```

Alternatively, you can add a script to your `package.json` to simplify the process:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint:fix": "standard --fix"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

This command will attempt to automatically correct style violations where possible.

## API Documentation

The API provides endpoints to interact with external data sources and deliver dynamic content. For detailed API documentation, you can:

- Access the Swagger UI at **[http://localhost:5005/api-docs](http://localhost:5005/api-docs)** when the server is running.
- Refer to the `swagger.json` or `swagger.yaml` files for endpoint specifications.

---

## API Formatting

All API endpoints return data in **JSON** format. Below are some guidelines for API formatting:

- **Standard JSON Structure:** All responses are returned in a structured JSON format, typically including keys like `status`, `data`, and `message`.
- **Success Responses:** Successful API calls generally return a `status` of `200` and include a `data` object containing the requested information.
- **Error Responses:** Error messages are formatted as JSON objects with `status` codes (`400`, `404`, `500`, etc.) and a descriptive `message` key to provide more details about the error.
- **Content-Type Header:** Ensure that requests include the `Content-Type: application/json` header when sending data to the API.

**Example Response Format:**

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "data": {
    "files": [
      "file1.csv",
      "file2.csv"
    ]
  },
  "message": "Files retrieved successfully"
}
```

This standard format ensures consistency across all endpoints, making it easier to handle responses on the frontend.
